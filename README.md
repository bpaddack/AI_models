This is a repository which demonstrates various A.I. Models and exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
techniques from various Python packages/libraries.

To run this code, the following packages will need to be installed in your Python environment. You can 
install the packages from your console/terminal with the 'pip' format:
> pip install seaborn
>
**Packages:**
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

1. FoodHub_EDA
   This is an EDA notebook that explores the 'foodhub_order.csv' dataset.

2. AllLifeBank_ML_DecisionTree
   This notebook uses the 'Loan_Modelling.csv' dataset to create 'Decision Tree' machine learning models.
   Steps to complete feature-engineering tasks are included. The following models are included:
   a. limiting the 'max_depth' of the tree
   b. performing a GridSearchCV
   c. Cost-Complexity (pre-pruning)
   d. Post-pruning

3. TheraBank_ML_Advanced
   This notebook uses the 'BankChurners.csv' dataset to create advanced machine learning models. These models include the use of
   oversampled and undersampled data approaches for the following models:
   a. AdaBoost
   b. GradientBoost
   c. XGBoost
   d. Random Forest
   e. Bagging
