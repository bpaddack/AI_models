# AI_models
Python code for various A.I. models

This is a repository which demonstrates various A.I. Models and exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
techniques from various Python packages/libraries.

To run this code, the following packages will need to be installed in your Python environment. You can 
install the packages from your console/terminal with the 'pip' format:
> pip install seaborn
>
**Packages:**
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

1. FoodHub_EDA
   This is an EDA notebook that explores the 'foodhub_order.csv' dataset.

2. AllLifeBank_ML_DecisionTree
   This notebook used the 'Loan_Modelling.csv' dataset to create 'Decision Tree' machine learning models. In this notebook,
   we create models for:
   a. limiting the 'max_depth' of the tree
   b. performing a GridSearchCV
   c. Cost-Complexity (pre-pruning)
   d. Post-pruning
